# This is the repository for Ben Puryear's CPSC222 final project.

## What files are what?
* The main file is titled [project.ipynb](project.ipynb)
* original_data\ contains the raw unprocessed data exported from my phone
* figures\ contains all .png files that are used/exported
* data\ contains all other .csv's created throughout the execution of [project.ipynb](project.ipynb), such as the [cleaned movement data with the moving average](data/clean_puryear_movement_step_ewm.csv)

## Thats cool but why?
* As the name suggests, this repository is meant for the final project of the Fall 2021 CPSC222 class that I am taking taught by Gina Sprint. 

## Usage
* You can use the output cached by jupyter notebooks, but if you want to make your own changes you first must:
    * Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
    * Then enjoy making changes!
